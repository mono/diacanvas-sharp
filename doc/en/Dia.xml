    <remarks>
      <para>
      The design is based on MVC Model/View/Controller.
      The <see cref="T:Dia.Canvas" /> only holds abstract data (using <see cref="T:Dia.Shape" /> objects), 
      the data is rendered by one or more <see cref="T:Dia.CanvasView" />'s.
      </para>
      <para>
      Excelent export facilities exists, both printing via <see cref="T:Gnome.Print" /> and SVG exporting via
      <see cref="T:Dia.ExportSVG" />.
      </para>
      <para>
      Objects can be rotated/sheared/resized/ etc. without the need to recalculate shapes and
      they can connect to each other with <see cref="T:Dia.Handle" />'s.
      The <see cref="T:Dia.Handle" />'s do not need predefined connection points, 
      but can connect to each other in a more generic way.
      Undo/redo functionality is also present.
