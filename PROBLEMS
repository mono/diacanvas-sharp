Type missing problems
---------------------

Property has unknown Type DiaAffine in Object Dia.CanvasItem
      	DiaAffine is not a real type, kind of halfish.
	Its realy a double [6] array.

Property has unknown Type DiaCanvasItemHandles in Object Dia.CanvasItem
	Defined in diatypes.c and diacanvas.h
	Maybe make a real type in c or make a manual wrapper class in C#

Crashes
-------

o Select all, then try to move stuff around.
o Drag the CanvasClock a couple of times.
o Edit the editable text.
o Drag the text.

Fields which are not what they seem to be
--------------------------------------------

o dia-canvas.h 
  DiaCanvasItem *root    is realy a DiaCanvasGroup
o dia-canvas-view.h
  GnomeCanvasItem *handle_layer		is realy a DiaHandleLayer

Character encoding problem (FIXED)
----------------------------------

When calling DiaPlacementTool (DiaCanvasImage.GType ...) the following error
occours:

It probably is a character encoding problem from Uni16 to utf-8/ascii.
